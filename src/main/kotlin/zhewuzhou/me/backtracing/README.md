# Backtracking

By default, backtracking is DFS solution if the next recursion happened in:
  
```kotlin
for (i in start until nums.size) {
    if (nums[i] <= remain) {
        comb.add(nums[i])
        backtrace(result, comb, nums, remain - nums[i], i)
        comb.removeAt(comb.lastIndex)
    }
}
```

Sometimes, in a situation of find the shortest or best paths, BFS is a nature choices.

# Tips

When deal with this kind of DFS/BFS search challenges, it is really importantï¼š
- Figure out the structure of the problem 
    1. What kind of visit/search strategy needed? 
    2. Does Visit order matter?
    3. When to terminate the search?
    4. How to determine if answer found?
